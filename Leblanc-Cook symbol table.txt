Leblanc-Cook symbol table 
More efficient than a stack
See Scott, supplement, for more details
Main ideas
Each scope is assigned a unique serial number.  
New scopes given new number as they are encountered.  (These numbers do not reflect nesting)
All identifiers are entered into one hash table with their attributes and scope number.
The hash table chains entries with the same identifier.
A separate scope stack records the scopes that belong to the current referencing environment.
